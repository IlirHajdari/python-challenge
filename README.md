# python-challenge

## Although the files and folders that make this project were created by me, SOME of the code within both main.py files is starter code from the course files that were given to every student within the class. Most of the starter code used from the project files for both projects can be found on lines 5, 13, 14, 17, and a few lines possibly making up the final portion of each main.py file...

## Description

The **python-challenge** project consists of two Python scripts designed to process data related to financial record and election results. Each script addresses specific issues:

1. **PyBank**: Analyzes financial data. It calculates total profit/losses, monthly changes, and identifies the greatest profit increases and decreases.
2. **PyPoll**: Processes election data via counting votes. It also determines vote percentages, and identifies the winning candidate.

## PyBank Analysis

The PyBank script processes a dataset that contains "Date" and "Profit/Losses" columns to calculate:

- The total number of months in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses."
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and their average.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).

## PyPoll Analysis

The PyPoll script processes a dataset containing "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate" columns to calculate:

- The total number of votes.
- A complete list of candidates who got votes.
- The percentage of votes each candidate won.
- The total number of votes each candidate won.
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
