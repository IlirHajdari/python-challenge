## Description

The **python-challenge** project consists of two Python scripts designed to process data related to financial record and election results. Each script addresses specific issues:

1. **PyBank**: Analyzes financial data. It calculates total profit/losses, monthly changes, and identifies the greatest profit increases and decreases.
2. **PyPoll**: Processes election data via counting votes. It also determines vote percentages, and identifies the winning candidate.

## PyBank Analysis

The PyBank script processes a dataset that contains "Date" and "Profit/Losses" columns to calculate:

- The total number of months in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses."
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and their average.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).
